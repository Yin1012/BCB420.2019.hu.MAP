## 1 About this package:
This package describes the workflow to utilize human protein complex data from the hu.MAP. The workflow demonstrates how to check if HGNC symbols inside database is latest, how to annotate the example gene set, and also provides examples of computing database statistics.

The package serves dual duty, as an RStudio project, as well as an R package that can be installed. Package checks pass without errors, warnings, or notes.

## 2 hu.MAP Data
hu.MAP refers to Human Protein Complex Map which attempts to address the lack of understanding of protein complex in human. This database combines serveral large scale protein interaction datasets to get most comprehensive understanding of human protein complexes. Protein inteaction network shows co-compelx potein pairs that are observed in protein complex map with corresponding probability score.The enrichments data is also included in the hu.MAP.
